# Understanding Microstrate Hub Workflows

## Introduction to Microstrate Hub

Microstrate Hub is a powerful integration platform that combines the simplicity of low-code tools with developer-grade capabilities. Built on Microstrate's revolutionary cloud infrastructure, Hub allows you to create sophisticated, stateful workflows that connect applications, process data, and automate complex business processes with unprecedented flexibility and performance.

## What Are Workflows?

A workflow in Microstrate Hub is a visual representation of a business process, integration, or automation sequence. Workflows consist of connected nodes that define how data flows and is transformed from one step to the next.

### Key Components of a Workflow

1. **Triggers**: The events that initiate your workflow
2. **Nodes**: Individual steps that perform specific actions
3. **Connections**: The paths data follows between nodes
4. **State**: Contextual information maintained between executions

## Flow Runs: Understanding Execution

A "flow run" refers to a single execution of a workflow from start to finish. Each time a workflow is triggered—whether by an API call, scheduled event, or external system—it counts as one flow run.

### Anatomy of a Flow Run

Each flow run progresses through several phases:

1. **Trigger Activation**: An event causes the workflow to begin execution. The can be the default endpoints for the flow, or a custom trigger
2. **Node Processing**: Each node in the workflow processes data in the order in which it is connected to the other nodes. This can be sequentially, or in parallel
3. **State Management**: The workflow maintains contextual information throughout the execution, and can be dynamically linked in each step.
4. **Completion**: The workflow finishes execution, either successfully or with errors

### Flow Run Metrics

Microstrate Hub provides detailed metrics for each flow run:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Duration | Total execution time from start to finish |
| CPU Time | Amount of compute resources consumed |
| Memory Usage | Peak memory utilized during execution |
| Status | Success, failure, or partial completion |
| Error Details | Information about any failures |
| Node Metrics | Performance data for individual nodes |

## Types of Workflows

### 1. Scheduled Workflows

Scheduled workflows run at predetermined intervals to perform tasks like:
- Data synchronization
- Report generation
- Periodic health checks
- Maintenance operations

**Example**: A daily workflow that aggregates sales data from multiple sources, calculates commissions, and emails reports to the sales team.

### 2. Event-Driven Workflows

Event-driven workflows respond to external triggers such as:
- API requests
- Database changes
- Message queue events
- Webhook calls

**Example**: A workflow that processes new customer sign-ups, creates accounts in multiple systems, sends welcome emails, and triggers onboarding sequences.

### 3. Data Processing Workflows

Data processing workflows transform, enrich, and route data between systems:
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- Format conversion
- Data validation and cleansing
- Analytics preprocessing

**Example**: A workflow that extracts data from CSV uploads, cleanses it, transforms it to match your database schema, and loads it into your data warehouse.

### 4. Integration Workflows

Integration workflows connect different applications and services:
- API orchestration
- Multi-system updates
- Cross-platform data synchronization
- Legacy system integration

**Example**: A workflow that ensures customer information stays synchronized across your CRM, marketing platform, support system, and billing service.

## What Makes Hub Workflows Different

### Stateful Execution

Unlike many workflow tools that treat each execution as isolated, Microstrate Hub workflows can maintain context and state between runs. This enables:

- Resumable executions
- Persistent variables
- Contextual decision-making
- Multi-step processes that span multiple triggers

This is achieved by using the inbuilt storage that comes with Microstrate Cloud, with state able to be stored with one workflow step, and retreived with another.

### Developer Extensibility

While Hub provides a visual interface, developers can extend capabilities by:
- Creating custom code nodes in multiple languages
- Deploying custom functions and containers
- Using custom functions, containers, streams, and storage directly in workflows
- Building reusable components
- Accessing the underlying Microstrate Cloud infrastructure by deploying custom stacks containing entire service architectures inlcuding functions/containers, storage, gateways etc.

### Enterprise-Grade Performance

Built on the same technology that powers Microstrate Cloud, Hub handles high-throughput, latency-sensitive workflows:
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Millisecond-level response times
- Elastic scaling based on demand
- Optimized resource utilization

### Advanced Function Ecosystem

Hub comes with sophisticated built-in functions:
- Rule engine for complex conditional logic
- JSON path mapping for data transformation
- Direct access to streaming for high-performance data handling
- Native storage integration with KV and object stores
- HTTP capabilities for API connectivity and custom integrations
- Specialized utilities (SFTP, Base64, templating)

## Best Practices for Workflow Design

### Collection management

Collections are designed to create a visual grouping of related flows for easy navigation and management. Keep similar and related flows together in the same collections. 

### Modular Design

Break complex processes into smaller, reusable workflows:
- Creates manageable components
- Improves reusability
- Simplifies testing and debugging
- Enables parallel development

### Error Handling

Implement robust error management:
- Add error handling paths for critical nodes
- Set up retry logic for transient failures
- Create notification alerts for failures
- Review logs for comprehensive error information. By default, logs are kept for 14 days.

### Performance Optimization

Optimize for execution efficiency:
- Use parallel processing where appropriate
- Minimize external API calls
- Implement caching strategies
- Use batch operations for bulk data

### Security Considerations

Build with security in mind:
- Store credentials in the secure secrets manager
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Workflow Limits and Scaling

Each Microstrate plan includes allocations for workflow resources:

| Plan | Active Workflows | Flow Runs/Month | Concurrent Function Executions\* |
|------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Starter | 3 | 300 | 10 |
| Pro | 25 | 10,000 | 100 |
| Business | Unlimited | 100,000 | 1,000 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Custom | Custom |

\* Concurrent function executions limit the number of total functions that can be run across your Hub and Cloud account at any one time.

### Understanding Active Workflows

An "active" workflow is one that is published and available for execution. The Starter plan allows up to 3 active workflows, but you can have additional workflows in draft mode for development purposes.

### Flow Run Consumption

Different workflow types consume flow runs differently:
- **Single-step workflows**: 1 flow run per execution
- **Multi-step workflows**: 1 flow run per complete execution
- **Long-running workflows**: 1 flow run per logical execution (even across days)

### Additional Flow Runs

If you exceed your plan's allocation, additional flow runs are billed at:
- Pro: $0.01 per additional run
- Business: $0.005 per additional run
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
