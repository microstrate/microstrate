# Microstrate Cloud & Hub Pricing Guide

## Understanding Your Cloud Investment

Microstrate isn't just another cloud platform – it's a revolutionary approach to cloud computing and workflow automation that fundamentally changes how your applications consume resources and scale. This guide explains our pricing structure, what makes each plan unique, and how our unified architecture delivers exceptional value.

Every Microstrate account gives you access to both the Cloud Platform, and the Hub workflow automation platform

## Our Unique Advantage

Before diving into the plans, it's important to understand what makes Microstrate different:

- **Unified Messaging Foundation**: Our platform eliminates the need to mix and match disparate messaging, serverless, containerized, queueing, and storage services.
- **CPU-Optimized Resource Model**: Our Hydra compute engine allocates resources based on actual CPU needs (down to the millicore level) rather than memory blocks, achieving better resource utilization.
- **Multi-Cloud Mesh**: Run resiliant workloads anywhere, with no extra work... – on-prem, private cloud, hybrid, or across multiple providers – with consistent performance.
- **Built-in Observability**: Every component emits consistent metrics and traces through OpenTelemetry, transported through our mesh architecture.

- **Hub Integration**: Build powerful workflows that connect to your cloud resources

## Understanding Your Resources

### [Compute Credits](/essentials/compute-credits)
One compute credit equals a 128MB function running continuously for one hour. Our millicore-based allocation means you're only paying for actual CPU usage, not idle resources, resulting in significantly better cost efficiency.

### Flow Runs
Each workflow execution in Hub counts as one flow run, regardless of complexity. This predictable pricing model makes it easy to forecast costs as your automation needs grow.

### Storage
Your storage allocation includes all data types in the Microstrate ecosystem: key-value stores, object storage, streams, and logs. This unified approach eliminates the need to manage separate storage services. Storage allocation includes replicas, so if your account has 3 replicas, you will consume your storage allocation at 3x

## Maximum Usage Limits

Additional capacity can be purchased beyond your plan limits:

| Resource | Maximum Limit per Account |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Storage | 500GB |
| Throughput | 100Mbps |
| Concurrent Executions | 1,000 |
| Gateway Requests | 5,000/second (up to 10,000/second with approval) |

Enterprise plans can exceed these limits

## How We're Different

Unlike traditional cloud providers that charge separately for compute, storage, messaging, and databases, Microstrate's unified architecture delivers:

1. **Simplified Billing**: One coherent pricing model versus multiple disconnected services
2. **Economic Efficiency**: Pay for exactly what you use, down to the millicore
3. **Predictable Performance**: Consistent experience regardless of where your workloads run
4. **Developer Experience**: Built-in observability and simplified workflows
5. **Security By Design**: Isolated networks, encrypted channels, and declarative security policies
6. **Integrated Workflows**: Seamless connection between Hub workflows and Cloud resources

## Common Questions

### How do compute credits work?
[Compute credits](/essentials/compute-credits) represent CPU time and are consumed based on the actual processing power your functions use. This millicore-based approach means you're not paying for idle resources, resulting in better utilization compared to traditional serverless offerings.

### What's the relationship between Microstrate Cloud and Hub?
Microstrate Hub is our advanced workflow automation platform built on top of the core Microstrate Cloud infrastructure. Hub leverages Cloud's capabilities to execute workflows, process data, and integrate with external systems. All Hub workflows run on the same high-performance infrastructure as your other Cloud workloads.

### What happens if I exceed my plan limits?
For most resources (compute credits, flow runs, storage), you'll be billed for additional usage at the rates specified in your plan. Your workflows will continue running without interruption.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
Yes, you can change plans at any time. When upgrading, the new limits and capabilities take effect immediately. When downgrading, changes apply at the start of your next billing cycle.

### How does Microstrate compare to AWS Lambda or similar services?
Unlike traditional serverless platforms that inefficiently allocate entire memory blocks, Microstrate's Hydra compute engine uses precision resource allocation (millicores) and eliminates cold starts through our multi-layered approach. This results in better performance, predictability, and cost efficiency.
