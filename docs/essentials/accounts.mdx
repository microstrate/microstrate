- **Option 1: Login Code**
  - Check your email for a message from Microstrate "Confirm Your Email Address"
  - Locate the 6-digit verification code
  - Enter this code on the verification screen
  
- **Option 2: Magic Link**
  - Check your email for a message from Microstrate "Confirm Your Email Address"
  - Click the "Confirm your email" link in the email
  - You'll be automatically redirected to a success page where you can then log into your new account

> **Note:** If you don't receive a verification email within 5 minutes, check your spam folder or click "Resend email" on the verification screen. If your email address isn't confirmed within 48 hours, the account will be removed automatically and need to be set up again.
