# Microstrate Cloud: Security Guide & Best Practices

## Introduction

Security is foundational to Microstrate's architecture. This guide outlines the security features available to protect your account and data, along with best practices for maintaining a strong security posture.

## Account Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Microstrate provides robust MFA options to protect your account:

#### Setting Up MFA

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Multi-Factor Authentication**
2. Choose your preferred authentication method:
   - **Authenticator App** (recommended): Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, and other TOTP apps
   - **SMS Authentication**: Receive codes via text message
   - **Email Authentication**: Receive codes via email (least secure option)
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup

#### Recovery Codes

When enabling MFA, you'll receive a set of recovery codes:

- Store these codes securely in a password manager or physical safe
- Each code can only be used once
- If you lose access to your MFA device, these codes provide emergency account access
- Once you've used all recovery codes, you'll need to contact support for account recovery

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise customers can configure SSO with their identity provider:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Single Sign-On**
2. Select your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.)
3. Configure the connection using the provided instructions
4. Test the integration before enforcing it company-wide

### IP Restrictions

Limit account access to specific IP addresses or ranges:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Network Security**
2. Enable "IP Restriction"
3. Add allowed IP addresses or CIDR ranges
4. Choose to apply restrictions to:
   - All users
   - Specific roles
   - Individual users

> **Note:** Always add your current IP address before enabling restrictions to avoid locking yourself out.

### Session Management

Control how users interact with your account:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Session Management**
2. Configure:
   - **Session Timeout**: Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity (15 minutes to 7 days)
   - **Maximum Sessions**: Limit the number of concurrent sessions per user (1-10)
   - **Session Device Tracking**: Enable to monitor which devices are accessing your account

## API Security

### API Keys

Secure your programmatic access to Microstrate:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → API → Keys**
2. Create appropriately scoped API keys:
   - **Full Access**: Administrative capabilities (use sparingly)
   - **Read-Only**: For monitoring and reporting tools
   - **Service-Specific**: Limit to specific Microstrate services
3. Set appropriate expiration dates for all keys

### Secop Models

Microstrate implements Secop (Secure Operation) security models throughout the platform:

- **Resource-Based Security**: Granular permissions for every resource
- **Intent-Based Authorization**: Access based on the operation being performed
- **Least-Privilege by Default**: Services start with minimal permissions

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management

- Use unique, complex passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially Admin accounts
- Never share passwords between team members
- Consider using a corporate password manager
- Implement a password rotation policy (60-90 days recommended)

### Password Recovery

If you've forgotten your password, Microstrate provides a secure recovery process:

1. **Initiating Password Recovery**
   - Visit the Microstrate login page at [https://app.staging.microstrate.io/en/login](https://app.staging.microstrate.io/en/login)
   - Click "Forgot password?" below the login form
   - Enter the email address associated with your account
   - Click "Send Recovery Email"

2. **Completing the Recovery Process**
   - Check your email for a message from Microstrate (subject: "Reset Your Microstrate Password")
   - You'll receive either:
     - A "Reset Password" link (recommended method)
     - A temporary recovery code (alternative method)
   - If using the link, click it to open the password reset page
   - If using the code, enter it on the recovery page when prompted
   - Create a new password following the strength requirements
   - Confirm your new password
   - Click "Reset Password"

3. **Post-Recovery Security Steps**
   - After successfully resetting your password, you'll be logged in automatically
   - You'll receive an email notification confirming the password change
   - All other active sessions will be terminated
   - You may need to re-authenticate your MFA if enabled
   - Previous API keys will remain active unless manually revoked

> **Security Note:** Password reset links expire after 15 minutes. If your link has expired, you'll need to restart the recovery process.

> **Admin Recovery Options:** Account administrators can assist other users with password recovery by navigating to **Account Settings → Users**, selecting the user, and clicking "Reset Password" from the user action menu.

### Access Control

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit user access and permissions
- Remove unused accounts promptly
- Require MFA for all privileged accounts
- Use role-based access control consistently

### Network Security

- Access the Microstrate console over HTTPS only
- When possible, use a dedicated device for administrative access
- Implement corporate network controls like VPNs when accessing from untrusted networks
- Consider setting up dedicated admin workstations for highest-privilege users

### Monitoring and Auditing

Microstrate provides comprehensive security monitoring tools:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Audit Logs**
2. Monitor:
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Permission changes
   - Resource creation and deletion
   - Configuration modifications
   - API key usage

Set up alerts for suspicious activities:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Alerts**
2. Configure notifications for:
   - Failed login attempts
   - New device logins
   - Administrative action alerts
   - Unusual API usage patterns
   - Account modification events

### Development Security Practices

- Keep your SDK and client libraries updated
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Never embed credentials in application code
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Incident Response

### Account Compromise Response Plan

If you believe your account has been compromised, take these immediate steps in sequence:

1. **Immediate Containment Actions**
   - Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Emergency Actions**
   - Click "Terminate All Sessions" to force all users (including attackers) to log out
   - Click "Restrict API Access" to temporarily suspend all API keys
   - Click "Lock Account" to prevent new logins while you investigate

2. **Change Critical Credentials**
   - Immediately change your password (use a complex, unique password)
   - Reset MFA if you believe it has been compromised
   - Revoke and regenerate all API keys
   - If using SSO, alert your identity provider to reset your credentials there as well

3. **Investigate the Breach**
   - Navigate to **Account Settings → Security → Audit Logs**
   - Look for:
     - Unfamiliar IP addresses or locations
     - Unusual login times
     - Unexpected permission changes
     - Suspicious resource creation or deletion
     - API calls from unknown sources
   - Document everything for later analysis

4. **Assess and Mitigate Damage**
   - Review all account resources for unauthorized changes
   - Check **Billing → Usage** for unexpected spikes
   - Verify configuration settings haven't been altered
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Reset any compromised Gateway credentials

5. **Re-secure Your Account**
   - Enable MFA if it wasn't already active
   - Implement IP restrictions if possible
   - Reduce session timeout lengths
   - Review all user access and remove unnecessary permissions
   - Consider implementing SSO with stricter controls

6. **Report the Incident**

   - Follow guidance from the security team for further actions

7. **Post-Incident Actions**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security policies if needed
   - Consider security training for team members
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Schedule a follow-up security review

> **Critical Note:** If you suspect the breach involves access to sensitive customer data, consult your legal team about potential notification requirements based on applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
