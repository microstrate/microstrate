Waypoints alter a route by directing it through the specified location(s). The API supports waypoints for these travel modes: driving, walking and bicycling; not transit.   You can supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (`|` or `%7C`), in the form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates. By default, the Directions service calculates a route using the waypoints in the order they are given. The precedence for parsing the value of the waypoint is place ID, latitude/longitude coordinates, then address.\n* If you pass a place ID, you must prefix it with `place_id:`. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see [Place Autocomplete and Directions](/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions).

Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.</div>\n* If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, the values go directly to the front-end server to calculate directions without geocoding. The points are snapped to roads and might not provide the accuracy your app needs. Use coordinates when you are confident the values truly specify the points your app needs for routing without regard to possible access points or additional geocoding details. Ensure that a comma (`%2C`) and not a space (`%20`) separates the latitude and longitude values.\n* If you pass an address, the Directions service will geocode the string and convert it into latitude/longitude coordinates to calculate directions. If the address value is ambiguous, the value might evoke a search to disambiguate from similar addresses. For example, \"1st Street\" could be a complete value or a partial value for \"1st street NE\" or \"1st St SE\". This result may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API. You can avoid possible misinterpretations using place IDs.\n* Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of points using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). You will find an encoded set is useful for a large number of waypoints, because the URL is significantly shorter. All web services have a URL limit of 8192 characters.\n  * Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon (`:`). For example: `waypoints=enc:gfo}EtohhU:`.\n  * You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the pipe character (`|`). For example, `waypoints=via:enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:| via:enc:udymA{~bxM:`\n\n##### Influence routes with stopover and pass through points\n\nFor each waypoint in the request, the directions response appends an entry to the `legs` array to provide the details for stopovers on that leg of the journey.\n\nIf you'd like to influence the route using waypoints without adding a stopover, add the prefix `via:` to the waypoint. Waypoints prefixed with `via:` will not add an entry to the `legs` array, but will route the journey through the waypoint.\n\nThe following URL modifies the previous request such that the journey is routed through Lexington without stopping:\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Boston,MA&destination=Concord,MA\n&waypoints=Charlestown,MA|via:Lexington,MA  \n```\n\nThe `via:` prefix is most effective when creating routes in response to the user dragging the waypoints on the map. Doing so allows the user to see how the final route may look in real-time and helps ensure that waypoints are placed in locations that are accessible to the Directions API.\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Using the `via:` prefix to avoid stopovers results in directions that are strict in their interpretation of the waypoint. This interpretation may result in severe detours on the route or `ZERO_RESULTS` in the response status code if the Directions API is unable to create directions through that point.</div>\n\n\n##### Optimize your waypoints\n\nBy default, the Directions service calculates a route through the provided waypoints in their given order. Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the waypoints parameter to allow the Directions service to optimize the provided route by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order. (This optimization is an application of the traveling salesperson problem.) Travel time is the primary factor which is optimized, but other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more may be taken into account when deciding which route is the most efficient. All waypoints must be stopovers for the Directions service to optimize their route.\n\nIf you instruct the Directions service to optimize the order of its waypoints, their order will be returned in the `waypoint_order` field within the routes object. The `waypoint_order` field returns values which are zero-based.\n\nThe following example calculates a road journey from Adelaide, South Australia to each of South Australia's main wine regions using route optimization.\n\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\norigin=Adelaide,SA&destination=Adelaide,SA\n&waypoints=optimize:true|Barossa+Valley,SA|Clare,SA|Connawarra,SA|McLaren+Vale,SA\n```\n\nInspection of the calculated route will indicate that calculation uses waypoints in the following waypoint order:\n\n```\n\"waypoint_order\": [ 3, 2, 0, 1 ]\n```\n\n<div class=\"caution\">Caution: Requests using waypoint optimization are billed at a higher rate. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/pricing#directions-advanced\">Learn more about how Google Maps Platform products are billed.</a></div>\n"

The available values for this parameter are:\n* `best_guess` (default) indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic. Live traffic becomes more important the closer the `departure_time` is to now.\n* `pessimistic` indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this value.\n* `optimistic` indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster than this value.\nThe default value of `best_guess` will give the most useful predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the `best_guess` travel time prediction may be shorter than `optimistic`, or alternatively, longer than `pessimistic`, due to the way the `best_guess` prediction model integrates live traffic information.\n"

You may wish to examine the original request for misspellings and/or an incomplete address.\n\nPartial matches most often occur for street addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request. Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more locations in the same locality. For example, \"21 Henr St, Bristol, UK\" will return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street. Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component, the geocoding service may suggest an alternative address. Suggestions triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match.\n"

Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data.\n* `administrative_area_level_2` indicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_3` indicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_4` indicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `administrative_area_level_5` indicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\n* `airport` indicates an airport.\n* `colloquial_area` indicates a commonly-used alternative name for the entity.\n* `country` indicates the national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.\n* `intersection` indicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.\n* `locality` indicates an incorporated city or town political entity.\n* `natural_feature` indicates a prominent natural feature.\n* `neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood\n* `park` indicates a named park.\n* `plus_code` indicates an encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See [https://plus.codes](https://plus.codes/) for details.\n* `point_of_interest` indicates a named point of interest. Typically, these \"POI\"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as \"Empire State Building\" or \"Eiffel Tower\".\n* `political` indicates a political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.\n* `postal_code` indicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.\n* `premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name\n* `route` indicates a named route (such as \"US 101\").\n* `street_address` indicates a precise street address.\n* `sublocality` indicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: sublocality_level_1 to sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.\n* `subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name\n* `tourist_attraction` indicates a tourist attraction.\n* `train_station` indicates a train station.\n* `transit_station` indicates a transit station.\n\nAn empty list of types indicates there are no known types for the particular address component, for example, Lieu-dit in France.\n",

A step is the most atomic unit of a direction's route, containing a single step describing a specific, single instruction on the journey. E.g. \"Turn left at W. 4th St.\" The step not only describes the instruction but also contains distance and duration information relating to how this step relates to the following step. For example, a step denoted as \"Merge onto I-80 West\" may contain a duration of \"37 miles\" and \"40 minutes,\" indicating that the next step is 37 miles/40 minutes from this step.\n\nWhen using the Directions API to search for transit directions, the steps array will include additional transit details in the form of a transit_details array. If the directions include multiple modes of transportation, detailed directions will be provided for walking or driving steps in an inner steps array. For example, a walking step will include directions from the start and end locations: \"Walk to Innes Ave & Fitch St\". That step will include detailed walking directions for that route in the inner steps array, such as: \"Head north-west\", \"Turn left onto Arelious Walker\", and \"Turn left onto Innes Ave\".\n",

Point coordinates are encoded using signed values. If you only have a few static points, you may also wish to use the interactive polyline encoding utility.\n\nThe encoding process converts a binary value into a series of character codes for ASCII characters using the familiar base64 encoding scheme: to ensure proper display of these characters, encoded values are summed with 63 (the ASCII character '?') before converting them into ASCII. The algorithm also checks for additional character codes for a given point by checking the least significant bit of each byte group; if this bit is set to 1, the point is not yet fully formed and additional data must follow.\n\nAdditionally, to conserve space, points only include the offset from the previous point (except of course for the first point). All points are encoded in Base64 as signed integers, as latitudes and longitudes are signed values. The encoding format within a polyline needs to represent two coordinates representing latitude and longitude to a reasonable precision. Given a maximum longitude of +/- 180 degrees to a precision of 5 decimal places (180.00000 to -180.00000), this results in the need for a 32 bit signed binary integer value.\n",

You can find code information at Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes or the ISO Online Browsing Platform.</aside>\n  \nThe following components may be used to influence results, but will not be enforced:\n\n* `route` matches the long or short name of a route.\n* `locality` matches against `locality` and `sublocality` types.\n* `administrative_area` matches all the `administrative_area` levels.\n  \nNotes about component filtering:\n\n* Do not repeat these component filters in requests, or the API will return `INVALID_REQUEST`: \n  * `country`\n  * `postal_code`\n  * `route`\n* If the request contains repeated component filters, the API evaluates those filters as an AND, not an OR.\n* Results are consistent with Google Maps, which occasionally yields unexpected `ZERO_RESULTS` responses. Using Place Autocomplete may provide better results in some use cases. To learn more, see [this FAQ](https://developers..google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/faq#trbl_component_filtering).\n* For each address component, either specify it in the address parameter or in a components filter, but not both.

Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.\n* If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header.\n* The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian."

This coordinate may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.\n  <div class=\"note\">Note: using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates - which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination. Using the address will provide the distance to the center of the building, as opposed to an entrance to the building.</div>\n- **Coordinates**: If you pass latitude/longitude coordinates, they they will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.\n- **Plus codes** must be formatted as a global code or a compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20):\n  - **global code** is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code (`849VCWC8+R9` is encoded to `849VCWC8%2BR9`).\n  - **compound code** is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit location (`CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA` is encoded to `CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA`).\n- **Encoded Polyline** Alternatively, you can supply an encoded set of coordinates using the [Encoded Polyline Algorithm](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using an encoded polyline.\n  - Encoded polylines must be prefixed with `enc:` and followed by a colon `:`.

This setting affects the value returned in the duration_in_traffic field in the response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical averages.

The available values for this parameter are:\n* `best_guess` (default) indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic. Live traffic becomes more important the closer the `departure_time` is to now.\n* `pessimistic` indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this value.\n* `optimistic` indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster than this value.\nThe default value of `best_guess` will give the most useful predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the `best_guess` travel time prediction may be shorter than `optimistic`, or alternatively, longer than `pessimistic`, due to the way the `best_guess` prediction model integrates live traffic information.\n"

Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a <code>place_id</code>, then use that Place ID to make a Place Details request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place Search request, see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields#places-api-fields-support\">Places API fields support</a>.</div>\n\nUse the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example: `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when specifying compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`.\n\nFields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See the [pricing sheet](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/) for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been requested.\n\n**Basic**\n\nThe Basic category includes the following fields: `address_components`, `adr_address`, `business_status`, `formatted_address`, `geometry`, `icon`, `icon_mask_base_uri`, `icon_background_color`, `name`, `permanently_closed` ([deprecated](https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations)), `photo`, `place_id`, `plus_code`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity`, `wheelchair_accessible_entrance`.\n\n**Contact**\n\nThe Contact category includes the following fields: `current_opening_hours`, `formatted_phone_number`, `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `secondary_opening_hours`, `website`\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\nThe Atmosphere category includes the following fields: `curbside_pickup`, `delivery`, `dine_in`, `editorial_summary`, `price_level`, `rating`, `reservable`, `reviews`, `serves_beer`, `serves_breakfast`, `serves_brunch`, `serves_dinner`, `serves_lunch`, `serves_vegetarian_food`, `serves_wine`, `takeout`, `user_ratings_total`.\n"

Each session can have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s) used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately).\n\nWe recommend the following guidelines:\n\n- Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.\n- Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended.\n- Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project.\n- Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one session will result in each request being billed individually.\n"

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian."

Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian."

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned.

All other addresses are returned in the preferred language.

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n* If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n* The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian."

If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is billed separately).\n\nWe recommend the following guidelines:\n\n- Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.\n- Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended.\n- Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console project.\n- Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session.
